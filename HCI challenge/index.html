            <ul>
                <li>Both applications have metaphorical icons, showing a smiling face for "Reactions" and a raised hand for "Raise Hand," with identical designs. The differences are:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Zoom has the "Raise Hand" option incorporated into "Reactions," which makes it difficult for the participant to find, as it is not easily visible. Webex has the two options side by side.</li>
                        <li>Zoom displays the labels of the two buttons ("Reactions" & "Raise Hand"), whereas Webex does not include any labels.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Both applications present idiomatic icons, with slightly different designs, representing a grid, the difference between the two being the fact that the labels are different: Zoom - "View", Webex - "Layout" (more descriptive).</li>
                <li>For text-only interaction: command to modify the screen layout ("change layout: columns").</li>

    <h3 class="chapter">III. Cognitive overload </h3>
    <div>
        Both Webex and Zoom can cause cognitive overload in special conditions or contexts, although the extent to which this occurs 
        can vary depending on several factors, such as the specific features being used, the number of participants, and the purpose 
        of the meeting. 
    </div>
    <ol>
        <li>
            For example, in large meetings or presentations, where there are many participants and the presenter is sharing a lot of 
            information, participants may experience cognitive overload as they try to process and retain all the information being 
            presented. This can be exacerbated if the presenter is using multiple features, such as screen sharing, video, and chat, 
            all at the same time.

            In addition, certain features, such as breakout rooms or polling, can also add to cognitive load if they are not used 
            appropriately or if participants are not familiar with how to use them. For example, if participants are asked to move 
            in and out of breakout rooms frequently, or if the instructions for using a polling feature are unclear, this can cause 
            confusion and cognitive overload.
        </li>
        <li>Technical difficulties: Technical difficulties such as poor internet connection, audio problems, and video lag can cause 
            cognitive overload by disrupting the flow of the meeting and requiring additional mental effort to resolve. This can lead to 
            frustration and cognitive overload, as participants try to process the information while dealing with technical challenges.
        </li>
        <li>When multiple participants are sharing their screens at the same time (Zoom) it can be difficult to keep track of everyone 
            and the information being shared. This can lead to cognitive overload, especially if participants are trying to follow multiple 
            conversations or presentations simultaneously. Keeping track of all this information can be challenging, especially if the meeting 
            is fast-paced or if there are distractions in the environment.
        </li>
        <li>Lack of structure: When meetings lack structure or a clear agenda, it can be difficult to follow the discussion and keep track 
            of important information. This can lead to cognitive overload, especially if participants are not sure what is expected of them or 
            if the meeting is disorganized. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 class="chapter">IV. Improvements</h3>
    <h3 class="zoom">ZOOM</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>For the web platform:
            <ul>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Difficulty finding and joining meetings, especially if users are not familiar with the platform.
                    <div>
                        Solution: Provide options for users to adjust the size of the video and content windows to fit their screen size and preferences. 
                         Also, consider providing a feature that automatically adjusts the window size based on the number of participants or the type of 
                         content being shared.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Difficulty managing multiple meetings or accounts.
                    <div>
                        Solution: Provide a clear and intuitive dashboard or workspace for users to manage multiple meetings or accounts. Allow users to 
                        switch between accounts or meetings easily and provide clear indications of which account or meeting they are currently using.
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For the mobile platform:
             <ul>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Limited screen space on mobile devices can make it difficult to view all meeting participants or share content effectively.
                    <div>
                        Solution: Provide options for users to adjust the size of the video and content windows to fit their screen size and preferences. 
                        Also, consider providing a feature that automatically adjusts the window size based on the number of participants or the type of 
                        content being shared.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Difficulty finding and joining meetings on mobile devices, especially if users are not familiar with the platform.
                    <div>
                        Solution: Provide clear and prominent links or buttons to join meetings on the Zoom mobile app homepage. Additionally, allow users 
                        to save frequently used meeting IDs or links for easy access.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Limited control options on mobile devices can make it difficult for users to manage meetings effectively.
                    <div>
                       Solution: Provide more control options for users on mobile devices, such as the ability to mute or unmute participants, manage 
                       screen sharing, and access advanced settings. Also, consider providing a feature that allows users to easily switch between video 
                       and audio-only modes to conserve bandwidth and improve performance.

        <li>For the web platform:
            <ul>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Cluttered interface during meetings, with too many buttons and controls, can make it difficult for users to find what they need and can be overwhelming.
                    <div>
                        Solution: Simplify the interface by reducing the number of buttons and controls displayed during a meeting. Group similar functions together and use clear and intuitive icons and labels to make it easier for users to navigate the interface. Also, 
                        provide users with the ability to customize the interface to their preferences.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Difficulty sharing and presenting content during a meeting, especially when using different file formats or when working with external applications.
                    <div>
                        Solution: Provide a more streamlined and intuitive process for sharing and presenting content during a meeting. Allow users to 
                        easily upload and share files from their computer or cloud storage, and provide options for converting files to a format that is 
                        compatible with Webex. Additionally, integrate with popular external applications and tools to make it easier for users to share 
                        content from those sources.
                    </div>
                </li>
                 <li>UI/UX problem: Limited engagement options can make meetings feel static and unengaging, leading to decreased participation and effectiveness.
                    <div>
                        Solution: Provide more engaging options for users to interact during a meeting, such as virtual whiteboards, polls, breakout 
                        rooms, and virtual backgrounds. These features can help increase engagement and participation, making the meeting more effective 
                        and productive. Additionally, allow users to customize their engagement options and choose the ones that best fit their meeting 
                        goals and preferences.

        <li>For the mobile platform:
             <ul>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Limited screen space on mobile devices can make it difficult to view all meeting participants or share content effectively.
                    <div>
                       Solution: Provide options for users to adjust the size of the video and content windows to fit their screen size and preferences. 
                       Also, consider providing a feature that automatically adjusts the window size based on the number of participants or the type of 
                       content being shared.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Difficulty finding and joining meetings on mobile devices, especially if users are not familiar with the platform.
                    <div>
                        Solution: Provide clear and prominent links or buttons to join meetings on the Webex mobile app homepage. Additionally, allow 
                        users to save frequently used meeting IDs or links for easy access.
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>UI/UX problem: Limited control options on mobile devices can make it difficult for users to manage meetings effectively.
                    <div>
                       Solution: Provide more control options for users on mobile devices, such as the ability to mute or unmute participants, 
                       manage screen sharing, and access advanced settings. Also, consider providing a feature that allows users to easily switch 
                       between video and audio-only modes to conserve bandwidth and improve performance.

    <h3 class="chapter">V. Empiric laws</h3>
    <div>
        The empiric laws of Fitts', Hick's, and steering can also be applied in the context of Zoom and Webex to optimize human 
        performance and efficiency during video conferencing. Here are some ways to apply these laws in Zoom and Webex:
        <ol>
            <li>
            Fitts' law: In Zoom and Webex, Fitts' law can be applied to predict the time required to select buttons or options within the 
            platform. For example, the distance and size of buttons and menus on the user interface can impact the efficiency and ease of 
            use of the platform. To optimize performance, designers can use Fitts' law to ensure that buttons and menus are appropriately 
            sized and spaced, and that the most frequently used options are easily accessible.
                <ul>
                    <li>For Webex, the "Share screen" button can be customized to stand out, just like it is in Zoom.</li>
                    <li>For Zoom, the "Chat" and "Participants" buttons should be moved to the bottom right, as it is in Webex, because windows would open above them and it would be much easier to navigate the application.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Hick's law: Hick's law can be applied in Zoom and Webex to reduce the cognitive load associated with decision-making during 
                video conferencing. For example, during a meeting, participants may be presented with multiple options for participation, such 
                as using video or audio only, using the chat feature, or raising their hand to ask a question. To reduce decision-making time 
                and cognitive load, designers can streamline the options and prioritize the most commonly used ones.
                <ul>
                    <li>On Webex, the "Raise hand" button could be incorporated into the "Reactions" button, just like it is in Zoom.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Steering law: Steering law can be applied in Zoom and Webex to optimize the time required to navigate within the platform. For 
                example, during a meeting, participants may need to switch between video feeds or share their screen. To optimize the time 
                required to steer between these options, designers can ensure that navigation options are appropriately sized and spaced, and 
                that participants can easily switch between options without unnecessary steps.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3 class="chapter">VI. New features</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Zoom: adding a preview window before entering a meeting, from where you can turn on/off the microphone and turn on/off the video camera, with the ability to see what the camera is showing. Additionally, there should be a "Join" button, so that the user can enter the meeting when ready and not be directly connected.</li>
            <img src="./static/images/preview.png">
            <li>AI-powered virtual background blur:
            As more people work and attend meetings remotely, there is a growing need for privacy and reducing distractions.
            Zoom or Webex could add an AI-powered virtual background blur feature that would intelligently detect the user's background and
            blur it out while keeping the user in focus. This feature can be especially helpful for people who work in busy or noisy
            environments, or in situations where they can't control the background.</li>
            <img src="./static/images/blur.webp">
            <li>The ability to create an avatar to be used when the camera is on, to make meetings more flexible and informal. This would be useful when the user wants to eat, hasn't had time to get ready, and may not want to be seen by other participants, but still wants to show that they are present in the meeting. Another reason is that an avatar is more interactive than a simple static profile picture.</li>
